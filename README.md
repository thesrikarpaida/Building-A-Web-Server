Building a Web Server is a module in the dojo [Intro to Cybersecurity](https://pwn.college/intro-to-cybersecurity/) in [pwn.college](pwn.college).

It consists of 11 levels. All the levels together finally build up to creating a web server in shellcode.

## Level 1
The shellcode exits a program.

## Level 2

## Level 4
The shellcode listens to a connection on the socket.

## Level 5
The shellcode accepts a connection.

## Level 6
The shellcode statically responds to an HTTP request.

## Level 7
The shellcode dynamically responds to an HTTP GET request based on the requested file to be read.

## Level 8
The shellcode dynamically responds to multiple HTTP GET requests.
